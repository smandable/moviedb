get path, filename, filesize, extension and copy all into an array.

Then preg_match $this file on extension, last dash, etc.

Repeat all steps but then compare the cleaned name to the one before.

If names are equal, then add filesize of 2nd to 1st and move to next.

I should end up with a11 info.

So.. I can still use arrays, I think that speed and array utilities will make up for the  readability of JSON.

Array will consist of filename, filesize, file extension, and filepath.

I'll really only be concerned with the names, for the db but I'll have the path, so if it's a dupe I can search the filesystem for another file of the same name
and get back it's path, size, extension. See if there's a way to search with Finder, maybe. Otherwise I'd have to list them and have a "delete" button next to it or something. And an open or "preview" link as well. Well, ok, just a relative url.
